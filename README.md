## CSC 436: Web Applications - Homework 1
This project is a part of Homework 1 for CSC 436: Web Applications. The homework is split into two main parts:

### Part 1: HTML Using Bootstrap
In this part, a simple HTML personal biography page has been created using Bootstrap. The biography page makes use of Bootstrap CSS styling and contains:
- A brief introduction and biography.
- A responsive image.
- Navigation links.
- A custom favicon, representing DePaul University's logo.

The project utilizes local Bootstrap CSS, and the page has been styled using a custom CSS file, `cover.css`.

### Part 2: JavaScript Exercises
The goal for this part was to update the code in `hw1.js` to provide solutions for the exercises. The solutions have been tested using Jest, a JavaScript testing framework.

### Submission
The project has been initialized as a Git repository and has been pushed to GitHub.

### Usage
To view the biography page, open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
